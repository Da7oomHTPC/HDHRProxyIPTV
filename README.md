# HDHRProxyIPTV (PFC)

HDHRProxyIPTV is an application for Windows that simulates the behavior of the server HDHomeRunÂ© device
in relation to clients, that will act as proxy to receive the flow of channels from different sources to
a real tuner, as they could be multicast IPTV sources. The access protocol that has been implemented to 
receive these flows is the HTTP protocol. These flows are sent on demand to customers in the protocol 
they expect.

The HDHRProxyIPTV project use to compile the library of HDHomeRun, libhdhomerun, 
(http://www.silicondust.com/support/downloads/linux/ -> libhdhomerun (source)), 
specifically the version 20100213.
